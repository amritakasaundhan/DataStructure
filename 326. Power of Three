first of all number has to be divisible by 3 throught in order to order to be its power. 
keep on dividing the number by 3 until its divisble by.
At the end if the n is equals to 1 return true else false.

class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if(n < 1){
            return false;
        }
        while(n%3 == 0){
            n = n/3;
        }
        return n==1;
    }
}
