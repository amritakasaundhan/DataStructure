Approach: Using two pointer approach:
at every node check if value of both nodes are equal, delete the next node and move second pointer
other wise move both the pointer nodes

class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
            return head;
        }
        ListNode curr1 = head;
        ListNode curr2 = head.next;
        while(curr2 != null){
            if(curr1.val == curr2.val){
                curr1.next = curr2.next;
                curr2 = curr2.next;
            }else{
                curr1 = curr1.next;
                curr2 = curr2.next;
            }
        }
        return head;
        
    }
}
